          <p><b>Abstract</b><br>

            It's not a mystery anymore the existence of planets orbiting different stars from our Sun. 
            The detection and future characterisation of the so-called exoplanets, also known as extrasolar planets, 
            is one of the main objectives of the VVV and the VVV-X surveys, which has been observed the Galactic bulge
            and disk regions during the past decade in five near-IR filters ZYJHKs. We selected red dwarf stars based on PSF
            photometry data and distinguished red dwarfs from red giants stars, spurious to our current analysis making use of 
            the astrometric data provided by the VIRAC and the Gaia DR2 projects. 
            This particular type of star becomes of great interest in exoplanetary studies due to its relative low dimensions and temperatures, 
            which maximised researches on potentially habitable, water-supported rocky exoplanets orbiting such stars. 
            Subsequently, we searched for relatively small periodic photometric variations implementing the Box-fitting least-squares method 
            in order to detect and fit exoplanetary transits. Through parameters such as transit depth, width and orbital period, 
            as well as knowing the spectral subtype of the central star, besides estimating its distance, it is possible to estimate the dimensions of the exoplanet, 
            as the radius, surface temperature,  and mass, also its density and surface gravity, important factors in the characterisation of a certain exoplanet as to its habitability.</p>

              <h3><b>A brief overview on exoplanetary studies</b></h3>

              Contemplating the formation of planets orbiting different stars from our Sun isn't something new and it has become unquestionable their existence nowadays. 
              Since ancient Greece, on the first speculations about <i>many bodies of all sorts and shapes moving from the infinite into a great void</i> by Leucippus (5th cn. B.C.E.), 
              to the existence of <i>infinite worlds both like and unlike this world of ours</i> by Epicurus (341-270 B.C.E.) (cite), exoplanetary studies evolved not only due to the advent
              of new technologies but also as a result of the human capacity to discover its past, associate it to the present and speculate its future. 
              The first Earth-like mass exoplanet was discovered orbiting a pulsar by Wolszczan and Frail (1992), and a few years later, the discovery of the first exoplanet orbiting a 
              main-sequence star, the 51 Peg by Mayor and Queloz (1995) earned the <A href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2019/summary/">2019 Nobel Prize in Physics</A> to the researches involved. In addition to these individual exoplanet detections, the first exoplanetary system discovered orbiting also a main-sequence star, the U And, was detected by Butler et al. (1999), consisting of 5 objects including the star itself.

               <br><br>

               The primary classification of a certain unknown-nature object as an exoplanet takes account into its clearly gravitational link to a star, if
               it present enough mass to assume a hydrostatic balance (&lt;13 M<sub>Jup</sub>, which is approximately the mass limit where thermonuclear fusion
               processes may occur), therefore presenting a round-shape and if its likely to <i>clear its neighboring region</i>. Some criteria can be used in determining the last characteristic, which includes the ability of a 
               body to scatter smaller masses out of its orbital region for a huge period of time, also known as the &Lambda;-discriminant (Stern and Levison 2002), 
               the &mu;-discriminant to separate bodies orbiting stars into planets and non-planets (Soter 2006), and also the &Pi;-discriminant, that allows us to categorise a body based only on
               its mass, semi-major axis and its central star mass (Margot 2015). 
               
               $$ \Pi = \frac{m}{M^{5/2}a^{9/8}} k \gt 1, \quad k = \sqrt{3} C^{-\frac{3}{2}} (100 t_{\odot})^{\frac{3}{4}}\frac{M_{\oplus}}{M_{\odot}} $$
               
               Unlike the other discriminant mentioned, &Pi; is totally theoretically based and does not use data from the Solar System planets in its formalism,
               making it applicable to exoplanetary systems of the most varied configurations different from ours. It is important to remark that the &mu;-discriminant requires an
               accurate census of the orbital zone and the &Pi;-discriminant is only applicable to circular orbits.

          <h3><b>M dwarf stars selection</b></h3>
          <p> 
              As they are relatively cooler and smaller compared to the Sun, red dwarf stars present strong lines of TiO, CaH, and VO 
              in their optical spectra, besides FeH and H<sub>2</sub>O molecules in their infrared spectrum (Baker 1938, Mould 1976). 
              The choice of such objects in our analysis is primarily based on the fact that their maximum emission occurs in near-infrared wavelengths, 
              observation range of the VISTA Variables in the Vía Láctea Survey (VVV; Minniti et al. 2010). 
              Since those objects present long life spans, whose energy generation is due to the <i>pp</i>-chain (<i>p</i> + <i>p</i> &rarr; <sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub>D + e<sup>+</sup> + &nu;<sub>e<sup>-</sup></sub>) 
              and given the large fraction of those present in the Galaxy, red dwarf stars become one of the main targets in the search of potentially habitable exoplanets.

              <br>

              Making use of <A href="https://vvvsurvey.org/">VVV Survey</A> (Minniti et al. 2010) multicolour data for tile <i>b294</i> located towards the Milky Way bulge (1.5<sup>°</sup> x 1<sup>°</sup> centered at <i>l</i>, <i>b</i> = 3.88<sup>°</sup>, -3.14<sup>°</sup>), 
              we selected M dwarf stars in order to analyse photometric variations due to exoplanets-like objects orbiting such stars. 
              Several effects increase the likelihood of life on M dwarf planets, including their abundance in the Galaxy (&asymp;85&#37; of 100+ billion stars) and the intense cloud formation on the star-facing side of tidally locked planets, responsible to reduce the overall thermal flux and equilibrium temperature differences between two sides of a planet (Yang et al. 2013).
              
              Both giant and red dwarf stars of spectral subtype M present similar near-IR colours range, for instance in <i>(J-H)</i> and <i>(H-K<sub>s</sub>)</i>
              colours, which makes the photometric selection solely inefficient. We adopted H<sub>J</sub> &gt; 68.9<i>(J-K<sub>s</sub>)</i> - 50.7 for M dwarf stars in order 
              to perform a better distinction between such objects making use of the astrometric data from the <A href="https://www.eso.org/sci/publications/announcements/sciann17222.html">VVV InfraRed Astrometric Catalogue </A> (VIRAC, Smith et al. 2018), 
              calculating the reduced proper motion of selected objects according to equation below. Moreover, from the <A href="https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia">Gaia DR2 data</A> (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018), 
              we selected only stars with parallax measurements larger than <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:overline">&omega;</SPAN> = 1 <i>mas</i>, especially due 
              to the relative proximity of M dwarf stars in the magnitude range of our data, which consequently present high proper motion, in contrast to red giant stars, 
              further away however reddish due to extinction effects in the Milky Way.

            Photometric variations in exoplanet-M dwarf system are relatively small, typically about 0.15<sup>m</sup> in K<sub>s</sub> filter (&lambda;<sub>Ks</sub> = 2.14 nm), 
            therefore we arbitrarily limited our selection in the VVV K<sub>s</sub>-band PSF light-curves to K<sub>s</sub> &lt; 14.8<sup>m</sup>, 
            consequently &sigmaf;<sub>Ks</sub> &lt 0.05<sup>m</sup>, which is expected to reduce the incidence of false positives in our analysis. 
            Furthermore, based on their near-IR colours, we estimated the spectral subtype for M dwarf class as a function of the colours &Gamma; &equiv; Y-J, &Pi; &equiv; Y-K<sub>s</sub> 
            and &Psi; &equiv; H-K<sub>s</sub>, following equation below, also estimated the distance of such objects making use of the observational apparent and theoretical magnitudes in J filter

            It is not surprising to say that one of the main objective of exoplanetary studies nowadays are focused on the detection and subsequent characterisation of potentially habitable
            water-supported rocky exoplanets, in other words, objects orbiting the so-called habitable zone (HZ) of its central star (Kopparapu et al. 2013). 
            Exoplanets with masses up to &approx; 0.10 M&oplus; represent a potential study laboratory for the origin of organic life, however, the
            detection of minerals only found in meteorites, such as (Fe,Cr)<sub>1.15</sub>(Ti,Fe)<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> (Heideite), Na<sub>2</sub>Mg<sub>4</sub>Cr<sup>3+</sup><sub>2</sub>(Si<sub>6</sub>O<sub>18</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)
            (Krinovite) and Fe<sup>0+</sup><sub>1.5</sub>Ni<sub>0.5</sub>P (Barringerite) for instance, may indicate numerous different chemical compositions in exoplanetary systems, 
            preventing in a certain level environments conducive to the presence and maintenance of organic life (Gaidos and Selsis 2007). <br><br>

          <h3><b>The Box-fitting least squares (BLS) method</b></h3>
        <p>
            In opposition to commonly implemented <A href="https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.timeseries.LombScargle.html">Fourier-like sinusoidal methods</A> (e.g. Ferreira et al. 2018, Ferreira et al. 2019), the BLS is a statistical method developed by Kóvacs et al. (2002) in order to detect transit-like 
            candidates by potential exoplanets (even exoplanetary systems and/or exomoons) modelling a periodic upside-down box in a time-series photometric data-set 
            &Lambda;&doteq;{t<sub>k</sub>, y<sub>k</sub>, &sigmaf;<sub>k</sub>, k = 1,2,...,n}. Four main parameters derived from the Python implementation <i><A href="https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/timeseries/bls.html">astropy</A></i>
            used in this work are the orbital period (P<sub>orb</sub>), transit duration (&tau;), transit depth (&delta;) and a reference mid-transit time by the first event (&phi;). 
            The algorithm works as follow: 
            <ul>
                <li>select a period and event duration grids that best apply to the case of M dwarf stars orbited by exoplanets;</li>
                <li>apply a <i>sigma-clip</i>w &sigmaf; = 3 cut in &Lambda;, which removes some outliers; </li>
                <li>apply a minimisation of <i>O(i<sub>1</sub>,i<sub>2</sub>)</i>, a function of the ingress and egress times, which determines the width and also the position of the <i>box</i> on a phase diagram.</li>
              </ul>
              
            Following the definitions:

            $$ \mathcal{L} \doteq \Delta K_\mathrm{s}=\max{(\delta)\equiv\mathcal{H}-\mathcal{L}} $$
            
            $$ \mathcal{H}\doteq \Delta K_\mathrm{s}\approx0 $$
            
            the differentiation &PartialD;<sub>(L,H)</sub><i>O(i<sub>1</sub>,i<sub>2</sub>)</i>, yields to the minimisation of the residual sum of squares.

            $$ \mathcal{O}(i_1,i_2) = \sum_{i=1}^{i_1 - 1}\tilde\omega_i^2(\tilde{x_i} - \mathcal{H})^2 + \sum_{i=i_1}^{i_2}\tilde\omega_i^2(\tilde{x_i} - \mathcal{L})^2 + \sum_{i = i_2 + 1}^{n}\tilde\omega_i^2(\tilde{x_i} - \mathcal{H})^2 $$
            
            $$ \tilde x_i = \left \{ \begin{matrix} \mathcal{L}, & \mbox{if }i\in[i_1,i_2] \\ \mathcal{H}, & \mbox{if }i\in[1,i_1)\cup(i_2,n]\end{matrix} \right.$$
            
            <br>
            
            Furthermore, the maximisation of <i>O(i<sub>1</sub>,i<sub>2</sub>)</i> yields to an (i<sub>1</sub>,i<sub>2</sub></i>)-independent equation, 
            with 

            $$ \mathcal{O} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\tilde\omega_i^2\tilde x_i^2 - \frac{\gamma^2}{\beta - \beta^2} $$

            It is remarkable to note that the third term of the equation above is (i<sub>1</sub>,i<sub>2</sub>)-independent, so we can define the Signal-Residue 
            (&#1064;) following equation below, which can be used to characterise the quality and the significance of the signal found.

            $$ \mbox{&#1064;} = \max \left[\sqrt{\frac{\gamma^2}{\beta-\beta^2}}\right]$$
            
        </p>

        <div class='panel-body'>
          <h3>Some results</h3>
          <p>
            We initially performed a cross-match between the b294 VVV catalogue, containing 4.591.100 stars with the Gaia DR2 catalogue and also the VVV InfraRed Astrometric Catalogue which resulted on
            897.672 stars. A total of 24.360 M dwarf stars were selected after the photometric and astrometric processes previously described, which 220 of them presenting possible exoplanetary transits such as those presented in the figures below.
